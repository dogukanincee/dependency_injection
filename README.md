Users are able to create reminders for various tasks or events they need to remember using the Android app called Reminder. The app's user-friendly layout makes it simple for users to add, update, and remove reminders.

The Android Architecture Components, including Room, ViewModel, and LiveData, are used by the Kotlin-coded Reminder App to manage the data and user interface. Furthermore, the app displays a list of reminders using RecyclerView and lets users interact with individual items.

These features are accessible in the Reminder App:

- A new reminder can be created by users through completion of a form that includes fields for the title, description, and time.

- To modify an existing reminder, the reminder item should be clicked and the necessary changes should be made.
- To delete a reminder, the reminder item should be swiped left.

The following technological stack was utilized in the creation of the Reminder App:

- The modern programming language, Kotlin, known for its safety, expressivity, and conciseness, was used.
- The Room, ViewModel, and LiveData Android Architecture Components were utilized as a framework for creating robust and maintainable Android apps.
- Room, a local database library that offers an object-oriented interface for interacting with SQLite databases, was used in the development process.
- Additionally, RecyclerView, a versatile and effective view for displaying a large data set, was used.
- The development process aimed to provide outstanding and useful Android apps using the Material Design design language's concepts and resources.

In conclusion, a simple yet powerful Android application is provided by the Reminder App that enables reminders for various tasks or events to be created, edited, and deleted by users. The management of data and user interface is handled by the Android Architecture Components, such as Room, ViewModel, and LiveData, and a user-friendly interface is provided that is easy to use and navigate. Additionally, the list of reminders is displayed using RecyclerView and each reminder item can be interacted with by users. With the Reminder App, the organization of users can be enhanced and important tasks or events will not be forgotten.
